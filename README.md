# Web-Socket

## About WebSocket

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides a full-duplex, persistent connection between a client and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, WebSocket enables real-time, bidirectional communication where both the client and server can send messages to each other at any time without the need to establish new connections.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Communication**: Enables instant data transfer between client and server
- **Persistent Connection**: Maintains a single, long-lived connection instead of multiple HTTP requests
- **Low Latency**: Reduces overhead by eliminating the need for repeated connection establishment
- **Bi-directional**: Allows both client and server to send messages independently
- **Efficient**: Uses a single TCP connection, reducing network overhead

### Common Use Cases:
- Real-time chat applications
- Live sports updates
- Collaborative tools
- Live dashboards
- Gaming applications
- Financial trading platforms
